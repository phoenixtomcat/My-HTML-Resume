            <li>Designed an open-source version of the Google Chrome Dinosaur game using Python and PyGame.</li>
            <li>Integrated the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm for unsupervised learning to train the game AI.</li>
            <li>Researched and explored Q-learning as an alternative method but prioritized NEAT due to time constraints.</li>
            <li>Led a team by delegating tasks, managing teammates, and coordinating efforts with the project coordinator.</li>
            <li>Documented design, testing, and operational records on the project website.</li>
